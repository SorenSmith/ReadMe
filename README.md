##  🙋‍♂️ Introducing Myself

### 👋 Hi, I'm Soren Smith!
I'm a **Data Analyst & Project Manager** passionate about the **IT industry** and **data science**. I thrive on transforming **complex data** into **actionable insights** while keeping projects on track. With certifications in **Data Analytics** and **Project Management**, I bring both technical precision and strategic execution to the table.

🔍 **What I do best:**
- **Data Analysis:** Crafting meaningful stories from raw data  
- **Project Management:** Delivering results on time and within scope  
- **Dashboards & Reporting:** Turning numbers into visuals that drive decisions  
- **Problem-Solving:** Finding solutions faster than you can say "pivot table"  

🚀 **Always Learning:** Currently diving deeper into **Python** and aiming to master more coding languages in the future.

🎮 **Fun Fact:** When I'm not wrangling data, you can find me playing video games and leveling up both in-game and in real life.
